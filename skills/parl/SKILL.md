# `parl` — UK Parliament CLI

`parl` is a single Node CLI that wraps every public UK Parliament data exposure as a facility. Each facility has its own skill in [`skills/`](../) under the spec-conformant short slug (`members`, `bills`, etc. — or, for the legacy ones still using the longer prefix, `uk-parliament-<slug>`). All of those skills delegate the actual data fetch to `parl`.

This file is the place to come when you need to know **how to run `parl`**, regardless of which facility you're working with. Per-facility specifics (endpoints, parameters, quirks) live in the facility's own skill.

## Quick start

```sh
parl <facility> <command> [args] [--option value]
node bin/parl.mjs <facility> <command> ...      # if `parl` isn't on PATH

parl --help                       # list every facility
parl <facility> --help            # list a facility's commands
parl <facility> <command> --help  # one-line help for a command
```

The CLI uses kebab-case flags (`--member-id 4514`) that map to camel-case library kwargs (`memberId: 4514`). Repeated flags accumulate into arrays.

## Output modes

| Flag | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `--json` (default) | Parsed JSON response printed pretty. |
| `--text` | Human-readable rendering (tables for lists, summaries for objects, raw string passthrough for non-JSON bodies). |
| `--raw` | Verbatim response body. |
| `--out <path>` | Stream binary downloads (PDFs, ZIPs) to disk. |
| `--user-agent <s>` | Override User-Agent for the request. |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Override request timeout (default 30s). |

## Idiomatic chains

- **Postcode → MP**: `parl pq postcode "SW1P 3JA"` (one call) or `parl members constituency-search` then `parl members constituency <id>`.
- **MP → recent voting**: `parl members search --name X --take 1` → take the `id`, then `parl commons-votes member <id> --take 25`.
- **Bill → debates**: `parl bills search --term "X"` → take `billId`, `parl bills stages <billId>`, then `parl hansard search-debates --term "X"`.
- **Committee inquiry**: `parl committees search --term "X"` → `parl committees business-search --committee-id <id>` → `parl committees oral-evidence-search --committee-business-id <id>`.
- **SI laid in date range**: `parl si search --laid-date-from 2026-02-16 --laid-date-to 2026-05-16 --take 500` (client-side; auto-pages).
- **Annulment / praying-period date**: `parl whatson annulment-date --date-laid 2026-04-23 --days-in-future 40`.
- **Next sitting day**: `parl whatson next-sitting Commons --date-to-check 2026-05-16`.

## Library use (Node + browser)

```js
import * as F from './lib/facilities/index.mjs';
const r = await F.members.search({ name: 'Cooper', take: 5 });
```

The library uses only `fetch` / `URL` / `AbortController` so the same source runs in Node 18+ and in modern browsers.

## Provenance and naming (read this once)

The repo's focus is **UK Parliament** material — both Houses, the
Commons / Lords Libraries, POST, the official Parliament APIs and
RDF / SPARQL / OData stores. Anything else is third-party.

Skill names encode provenance tier ([`docs/provenance.md`](../../docs/provenance.md)
has the full convention):

| Naming | What it means |
|---|---|
| **No prefix** (`members`, `bills`, `hansard`, `treaties`, `si`, …) | **Tier 1**: first-party Parliament. Authoritative. |
| **`scraped-<name>`** | **Tier 2**: data Parliament publishes only as HTML/PDF, processed by *our* heuristic scrapers. Authoritative upstream, heuristic interpretation. |
| **`<producer>-<name>`** (`mysoc-twfy`, `tna-legislation`, `ec-donations`, `wikidata`, …) | **Tier 3**: third-party service. Operator named by the prefix. |

When you use this skill or any facility skill in an answer:

- Cite the source briefly **once per paragraph** — e.g. "(via
  `bills-api.parliament.uk`)" or "(per TheyWorkForYou)". Don't
  repeat for every clause; don't write a long formal citation
  unless the user asks for one.
- If you **combine** facilities, attribute each fact to its
  source. Prefer "per `members`: X; per `mysoc-twfy`: Y" over a
  merged sentence.
- **Never up-rate confidence.** Tier-2 (scraped) and tier-3
  (third-party) facts must not be presented as if they came
  straight from Parliament's authoritative graph. Say "likely",
  "according to", "per …" where appropriate.
- If a record carries `_field_sources` (mixed-source facility),
  treat each field's provenance independently.

The `--raw` flag prints the actual URL the CLI hit; that's the
canonical machine-readable source if the user asks "where did
this come from".

## Cross-cutting notes

- **Server vs client filtering**: where the upstream API has no date filter we want, the library auto-pages and applies the filter client-side, returning the same `{ items, totalResults }` envelope plus `_unfilteredTotal`, `_fetched`, `_exhausted` metadata. Currently applies to `treaties.search` and `si.search`.
- **Honesty about coverage**: every fact returned should be backed by a tool call. The CLI prints the URL it called via `--raw`; cite it.
- **Three triple stores**: Parliament runs three RDF triple stores, two public ([`docs/triple-stores.md`](../../docs/triple-stores.md)). DDP is what `sparql` fronts; DD (procedural ontology) is NOT on the public SPARQL endpoint — for procedural-business queries that come back empty, drop down to the matching REST API.
- **Specs**: cached OpenAPI specs live in [`_specs/`](../../_specs/). The probe script at [`scripts/probe-endpoints.sh`](../../scripts/probe-endpoints.sh) confirms every endpoint is reachable.
