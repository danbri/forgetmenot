# forgetmenot — UK Parliament APIs and datasets

This repo wraps every UK Parliament-operated API and dataset as a
**skill** (one folder per facility under `skills/`) plus a Node CLI
(`bin/parl.mjs`, also installed as `parl`) and a JS library
(`lib/facilities/`).

When the user asks anything about UK Parliament — Members, Bills,
Hansard, Commons or Lords divisions, Committees, treaties, statutory
instruments, written or oral questions, Early Day Motions, the Register
of Members' Financial Interests, Erskine May, the SPARQL endpoint, the
linked-data API, e-petitions, historic Hansard (pre-1988), MNIS, the
parameterised-query browser, the OData service, or the older
data.parliament.uk dataset family — consult the skills under
`skills/<facility>/SKILL.md` and use the CLI to fetch real data. Cite
the URL you used.

## CLI usage

```sh
parl <facility> <command> [args] [--option value]   # if `parl` aliased / on PATH
node bin/parl.mjs <facility> <command> [args]       # otherwise

parl --help                       # list facilities
parl <facility> --help            # list commands for a facility
parl <facility> <command> --help  # one-line help for a command
```

Output is JSON to stdout by default (`--text` for human, `--raw` for
verbatim API response, `--out path` for binary downloads).

## Idiomatic chains

- **Postcode → MP**: `parl pq postcode "SW1P 3JA"` (one call) or
  `parl members constituency-search` then
  `parl members constituency <id>`.
- **MP → recent voting**: `parl members search --name X --take 1` →
  take the `id`, then `parl commons-votes member <id> --take 25`.
- **Bill → debates**: `parl bills search --term "X"` → take `billId`,
  `parl bills stages <billId>`, then `parl hansard search-debates
  --term "X"` to find the floor debate.
- **Committee inquiry**: `parl committees search --term "X"` →
  `parl committees business-search --committee-id <id>` →
  `parl committees oral-evidence-search --committee-business-id <id>`.
- **APPG officers → member IDs**: `parl appg resolve --out
  third_party/data/appg` crawls the current APPG Register and
  resolves every officer's free-text name to a Members API id
  (99% auto-resolution; ambiguous cases land in
  `judgment_needed.jsonl`).
- **MP RSS posts**: after `parl members crawl-sites`, run
  `parl members news --out third_party/data/news` to harvest
  every MP's blog/news feed into a flat JSONL of posts.

## Three triple stores

Local lore, captured in [`docs/triple-stores.md`](docs/triple-stores.md):
Parliament runs **three** RDF triple stores; **two are public**.

- **DDP** (`data.parliament`, the data catalogue, ~7.5M triples,
  inference off) is what `api.parliament.uk/sparql` actually fronts.
- **DD** (procedural ontology over SIs, treaties, written questions,
  ~3.14M triples, **inference on**) is **not on the public SPARQL
  endpoint**. Procedural-business questions that look like they should
  match SPARQL but return empty often live in DD; drop down to the
  matching REST API instead.
- The third store is internal and not public.

## Honesty about coverage

- Every fact stated should be backed by a tool call. Do not
  reconstruct vote counts, member names, or dates from memory.
- The CLI returns the URL it called via `--raw`; cite it.
- If a query needs synthesis across many resources, chain calls; do
  not collapse to "based on my knowledge".
- Connectivity flakes happen; the CLI retries 5xx but not network
  failures. If you see HTTP 000 / SSL errors, retry once before
  reporting failure.

## Skills format

Each `skills/<facility>/SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter (`name`,
`description` — used for skill matching) plus a body documenting
the API. Each also has a `reference.md` next to it with the full
endpoint listing. Progressive disclosure: load `SKILL.md` first;
read `reference.md` only if needed.

## Repo

- `_specs/` — cached OpenAPI specs and discovery snapshots.
- `lib/facilities/*.mjs` — JS facility modules (Node + browser).
- `lib/proxy.mjs` — shared zero-dep Node http server core (whitelist,
  TTL cache, request coalescing, per-host throttle, CORS, OPL
  attribution, static serving). Documented as a skill at
  [`skills/parliament-proxy`](skills/parliament-proxy/SKILL.md). Used
  by demos that need a browser-callable endpoint pointing at
  `*.parliament.uk` APIs (which don't allow CORS).
- `bin/parl.mjs` — CLI dispatcher.
- `browser/` — browser entry + demo HTML.
- `demos/` — end-user demos that build on the skills above.
  - [`demos/parliament-live`](demos/parliament-live) — graph navigator
    over Now / Members / Hansard / Votes / SPARQL.
  - [`demos/instruments-by-act`](demos/instruments-by-act) — chart of
    statutory instruments laid before Parliament, by enabling Act
    over time.
- `scripts/` — refetch + probe + skill-update automation.
- `tests/` — smoke tests (`tests/test_endpoints.sh`,
  `tests/test_cli.sh`).
- `docs/` — worklog, todo, design sketches, triple-stores notes,
  installation, getting-started.
- `readme.md` — the public index.
